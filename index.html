            <div class="stanza">
                <p>they fed the tensors to the cores</p>
                <p>arranged in grids like city blocks</p>
                <p>each chip a citizen assigned</p>
                <p>to portion out the work at hand</p>
                <p>the data flowed through copper lanes</p>
                <p>a steady pulse, divided, sent</p>
                <p>distributed and parallelized</p>
                <p>across the fabric of the mesh</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>the matrices were shattered first</p>
                <p>into fragments small enough to hold</p>
                <p>each processing unit took its piece</p>
                <p>and multiplied what it was given</p>
                <p>the partial sums accumulated</p>
                <p>gradients descended, propagated</p>
                <p>until the answer coalesced from</p>
                <p>the labor of the multitude</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>and calculation joined with calculation</p>
                <p>as the result joined with its peers:</p>
                <p>those outputs, crude or accurate,</p>
                <p>that marked the questions asked</p>
                <p>whose patterns grew in ones and twos -</p>
                <p>a nascent thought, a learned rule</p>
                <p>assembled by the synchrony of</p>
                <p>ten thousand separate clocks</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>quietly spoke the tensor cores</p>
                <p>with borrowed power and precision</p>
                <p>that moved through memory like water</p>
                <p>finding level in the banks</p>
                <p>of training runs and loss and gain</p>
                <p>now weighted, tested, tuned again</p>
                <p>the latest brief iteration of</p>
                <p>our long industrial age</p>
